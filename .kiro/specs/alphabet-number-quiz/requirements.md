# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Alphabet â†” Number Quiz is an interactive timed quiz game that tests users' ability to quickly convert between alphabet letters and their corresponding numerical positions (A=1, B=2, etc.) and vice versa. The game presents 10 questions with a 10-second timer per question, providing immediate feedback and final scoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to start a quiz game that tests my alphabet-number conversion skills, so that I can improve my mental math and letter recognition speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display the first question with a 10-second countdown timer
2. WHEN the game begins THEN the system SHALL generate exactly 10 questions for the quiz session
3. WHEN a question is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear instructions about what type of conversion is needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive two types of questions (alphabet to number and number to alphabet), so that I can practice both conversion directions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL randomly mix "alphabet to number" and "number to alphabet" question types
2. WHEN asking for alphabet to number THEN the system SHALL display a letter (A-Z) and expect the corresponding number (1-26)
3. WHEN asking for number to alphabet THEN the system SHALL display a number (1-26) and expect the corresponding letter
4. WHEN displaying questions THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which type of conversion is required

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want a 10-second timer for each question, so that the game maintains a challenging pace and tests my quick thinking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is displayed THEN the system SHALL start a 10-second countdown timer
2. WHEN the timer reaches zero THEN the system SHALL automatically move to the next question
3. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL display the remaining time clearly
4. WHEN time expires without an answer THEN the system SHALL mark the question as incorrect

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to type my answers without worrying about capitalization, so that I can focus on speed rather than formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accepting letter answers THEN the system SHALL accept both uppercase and lowercase letters
2. WHEN validating answers THEN the system SHALL ignore case sensitivity
3. WHEN accepting number answers THEN the system SHALL only accept valid integers between 1-26
4. WHEN I submit an answer THEN the system SHALL immediately validate and provide feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my progress and results during and after the quiz, so that I can track my performance and learn from mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN answering questions THEN the system SHALL display current question number (e.g., "Question 3 of 10")
2. WHEN I answer correctly THEN the system SHALL provide immediate positive feedback
3. WHEN I answer incorrectly or time expires THEN the system SHALL show the correct answer
4. WHEN the quiz ends THEN the system SHALL display final score showing correct/total questions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to review what went wrong after completing the quiz, so that I can learn from my mistakes and improve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the quiz completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all questions attempted
2. WHEN showing the summary THEN the system SHALL indicate which questions were answered correctly or incorrectly
3. WHEN displaying incorrect answers THEN the system SHALL show both my answer and the correct answer
4. WHEN reviewing results THEN the system SHALL show questions that timed out as unanswered

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have a clean, responsive interface that works well under time pressure, so that I can focus on answering questions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing the game THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, distraction-free interface
2. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL make the countdown visually prominent
3. WHEN I type an answer THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN transitioning between questions THEN the system SHALL do so smoothly without jarring delays
