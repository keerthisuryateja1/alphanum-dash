- ✅ Quiz completion and results display
- ✅ Score calculation accuracy
- ✅ Restart functionality

**Verification Points**:
- Initial state: `not-started` with 0 questions/answers
- Active state: `active` with 10 questions generated
- Completed state: `completed` with 10 answers recorded
- UI section transitions: start → quiz → results
- Score tracking: correct/incorrect/timeout counts

### ✅ Timer Integration Test
**Requirements Covered**: 3.1, 3.2

**Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Timer countdown functionality (10 seconds per question)
- ✅ Visual timer state changes (normal → warning → danger)
- ✅ Automatic question progression on timeout
- ✅ Timer reset for new questions
- ✅ Timer accuracy and callback execution

**Verification Points**:
- Timer starts at 10 seconds for each question
- Timer counts down correctly (verified with 2-second intervals)
- Warning state applied at ≤5 seconds
- Danger state applied at ≤3 seconds
- Question automatically advances when timer reaches 0
- Timer resets to 10 seconds for next question

### ✅ UI State Changes Test
**Requirements Covered**: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3

**Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Section visibility management (start/quiz/results)
- ✅ Input field state changes (enabled/disabled)
- ✅ Progress indicator updates
- ✅ Feedback display for different answer types
- ✅ Input validation feedback
- ✅ Button state management

**Verification Points**:
- Correct section displayed for each game state
- Input enabled during active quiz, disabled otherwise
- Progress shows current question number (1-10)
- Feedback styling matches answer result (correct/incorrect/timeout)
- Validation messages appear for invalid input
- Restart functionality returns to initial state

### ✅ Mixed Performance Test
**Requirements Covered**: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3

**Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Correct answers with immediate feedback
- ✅ Incorrect answers with correction display
- ✅ Timeout scenarios with automatic progression
- ✅ Mixed result tracking and calculation
- ✅ Detailed results display with all scenarios
- ✅ Performance statistics generation

**Test Pattern**:
```
Question 1: Correct answer
Question 2: Incorrect answer  
Question 3: Timeout (no answer)
Question 4: Correct answer
Question 5: Incorrect answer
... (continues with mixed scenarios)
```

**Verification Points**:
- Each scenario type properly recorded
- Feedback matches scenario type
- Final score reflects mixed performance
- Detailed results show individual question outcomes
- Performance statistics calculated correctly

## Usage Instructions

### Running Interactive Tests
1. Open `test-integration-complete-game-flow.html` in a browser
2. Use the test panel on the right to run individual tests
3. Monitor real-time progress and results
4. Review detailed logs and test outcomes

### Running Automated Tests
1. Open `test-integration-automated.html` in a browser
2. Click "Run All Tests" to execute the complete suite
3. Monitor console-style output for detailed progress
4. Review comprehensive test summary and metrics

### Verification
1. Open browser console and run `verify-integration-tests.js`
2. Check that all dependencies and DOM elements are available
3. Ensure all verification tests pass before running main tests

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators
- ✅ All tests show "PASSED" status
- ✅ Success rate: 100%
- ✅ No failed test results in summary
- ✅ Game completes full cycle without errors

### Common Issues
- ❌ Missing DOM elements: Ensure all required HTML elements are present
- ❌ Class not found: Verify `script.js` is loaded correctly
- ❌ Timer issues: Check browser compatibility and focus handling
- ❌ State management: Verify game state transitions work correctly
